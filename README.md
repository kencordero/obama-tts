obama-tts
=========
This is a project I wrote for a class in 2008. I was pleased with what I presented, but I always felt it could have been so much more.

The goal of the project was to create a text-to-speech module that would take input text and output an audio file with Obama speaking the text. Equipped with the audiobooks for his books, I thought there was plenty to work with... and there was. As it turns out though, it's a substantial amount of nontrivial work parsing all of the words from the audio files. I didn't look into ways of doing this algorithmically, so it was all done manually.

Going forward, perhaps I will find a way to make this more robust.

Unfortunately, I cannot post the files of the Obama audiobooks as they are, no doubt, copyrighted works. If however you have (or obtain) copies, this code can work for you, too.
