obama-tts
=========
This is a project I wrote for a class in 2008. (If memory serves, it was a course on Data Visualization.) I was pleased with what I presented, but I always felt it could have been so much more.

The goal of the project was to create a text-to-speech module that would take input text and output an audio file. I had copies of Obama's books in audiobook format, so I decided that his voice would make an excellent test for my abilities. 

As it turns out though, it's a substantial amount of trivial, yet tedious work parsing all of the words from the audio files. Due to time constraints I didn't look into ways of doing this algorithmically, so it was all done manually. Going forward, perhaps I will find a way to make this more robust.

Unfortunately, I cannot post the files of the Obama audiobooks as they are, no doubt, copyrighted works. If however you have (or obtain) copies, this code can work for you, too.  

There are some sample outputs located in the samples folder.
